Palindrome linkded list

 abcba - > 
 Elements reading from the forward and backward are the same or 
 when the elements are read from the middle to the right and to the left are the same

 Two cases 
 even & odd  list
  abcba - skip middle 
  abccba - start from middle and read left and right
  
  question:

  Given a linkded list we have say if it is a paliondrome or not 

  in case of linked list we can only move forward not backward

  a -> b -> c -> b -> a [given linked list]

  a -> b -> c -> b -> a [reverse linkded list]

  given_linked list = reverse linked list then return paliondrome

  To increase efficieny 
  -> Take a stack 
  -> Take half of the linked list and put it in the stack
